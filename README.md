#  Credit Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning

A data science project that predicts the likelihood of loan default based on applicant information. This project uses machine learning models to assess risk and help financial institutions make better lending decisions.

## Overview

This project explores a dataset of loan applicants and builds a classification model to determine whether an applicant is likely to default. The goal is to simulate a real-world credit scoring system.

Key steps include:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model building and evaluation

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.13**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **pandas, numpy**
- **matplotlib, seaborn**
- **scikit-learn**

---

## Dataset

The dataset is based on the **German Credit Data** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:  
[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data))

It contains information on 1,000 loan applicants with features such as:
- Credit history
- Loan amount
- Employment status
- Purpose of loan
- Personal details

---

## Model

The primary model used is a **Random Forest Classifier**, but other models like Logistic Regression and XGBoost may also be explored.

Evaluation metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision & Recall
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC AUC Score
